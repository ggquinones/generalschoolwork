								Skyler Davis is a left-handed former professional pitcher from San Bernardino, California. In high school, Skyler Davis was an all around athlete,
								competing in almost every sport and excelling. Skyler gained a passion with playing volleyball early on and was soon one of the top players in the 
								country, excelling on the top stages throughout the United States and Internationally. <br><br>
								Skyler started his college career as a pitcher for Galveston Community College and was later drafted by
								the Houston Astros, opting to return for his second year of college to further develop his throwing skills.
								While in college, he suffered an injury that would hamper his ability to throw the fast ball with age and he
								decided it was time to go back to his first true love: beach volleyball. Skyler’s beach volleyball career has
								been marked with great accomplishments. He was the top ranked player in Texas for four years, one of the top ranked
								east coast players for five years, and later took his game to the AVP stage where he was runner-up newcomer of the
								year to the great Mike Lambert. On the tour, he played with and beat some of the greatest volleyball players of our
								time. His work ethic and drive led him to be known as a defensive presence on the court. Dale has won some of the
								most prestigious tournaments in the country. Twice he has won the Motherload tournament, making him the only player
								to ever win the tournament on both big and short courts! He has won the Chevy Freedom over Texas tournament three times,
								placed as high as 13th on the AVP tour 3 times, and won more east and west coast tournaments to mention here. 
								<br><br>
								For the last few seasons, Dale has been hampered by a hip injury that has limited his playing ability. This has
								led him to focus his attention on coaching, where he has been training some of the top semi-pro players in Texas.
								In the offseason he trains with Olympic gold medalist Phil Dalhausser and numerous other top AVP players to harness
								his skills. During his playing days before his injury, Dale would spend the offseason months living in Myrtle Beach
								training and playing with dozens of Professional Beach Volleyball players including Phil, Adam Roberts, Nick Lucena,
								Paul Baxter, Brian Soldano, etc. With his vast amount of quality beach volleyball coaching and playing experience, he
								has achieved great success in building and maintaining the highest level of respect amongst players and students as well
								as other Instructors.
								<br><br>
								Dale is on site at most practices and has worked with Phil to develop the curriculum that is taught at Champion Beach Volleyball.  
								Dale teaches Intermediate through Advanced Training as well as oversees the other programs.  Along with being a professional instructor, 
								Dale owns and operates several other business ventures.
