						CBVC “A” (Advancement) Team is for players age 12-25 who are interested
						in learning proper technique and becoming a better volleyball player. 
						CBVC is also for players looking to build strength and skills to help 
						their indoor game. Our system believes in teaching the advanced skills 
						from the beginning of a player’s career. For example, hand setting; even
						though the player may choose to bump set in tournaments, they should be 
						hand setting in practice to master the skill for the future. “A” Teams 
						will play in all of the same tournaments as the Select teams with the 
						exception of the open level tournaments. Practices will teach the proper
						skill techniques, mental toughness and proper decision making. As players
						demonstrate these abilities, they will be invited to play on the Select 
						Team. The advantage of going through the A Team is that the player is 
						learning proper techniques and are constantly under CBVC coaching supervision
						to be moved up to the Select Team. Select Team practices are more strategy
						based compared to A Team practices, which are more skill based. CBVC
						understands players develop at different rates, so all players are
						accepted. CBVC believes in installing confidence in new players
						instead of making cuts like other programs. Although we expect these
						players to work hard, practices will not be as intense as Select Team
						practices due to differences in age groups and physical fitness levels.
						Practices will be twice a week plus tournaments on the weekends. All
						players will receive a ball and uniform.

				<div class="panel panel-default w3-border-black">
					<div class="panel-heading w3-black w3-center">Select Team</div>
					<div class="panel-body">
						To make the CBVC Select Team, players must consistently demonstrate the ability
						to make the right decisions each play, be mentally ready, physically fit, have
						the drive to play at a higher level, and a winning attitude. Players must also
						take a short written test to ensure each player has completely learned the
						necessary skills and strategies to play on the select team. Players selected
						for the CBVC Select Team will receive customized coaching techniques to fit 
						their style of game that will give them the best chance of winning. For example;
						a shorter player will build their game around defense and the sideout game.
						A tall player might build theirs around blocking.Every player needs something
						a little different. CBVC Select will utilize our practice time to isolate
						each player’s needs. CBVC Select teams will actually compete in qualifiers
						before the tournaments. Top finishing teams will receive covered entry fees
						for that particular weekend tournament. This gives the players the same feel
						and pressures as going through a professional qualifier. Players will also
						receive their own ball and autographed uniform. There are many privileges
						to being selected to the CBVC Select team, but we expect hard work in return.
						CBVC Select is intended only for players ages 16-20 that not only possess 
						the athletic ability but the desire to play at a higher level. This program
						is not for players that are just playing for the enjoyment. Practices are
						extremely strenuous and we work hard on becoming a better player. CBVC will
						only tolerate winning and positive attitudes. We want you to learn how to win
						humbly and lose gracefully. Practices will be used efficiently. Practice
						is not a place to share the recent gossip or chat with your girlfriends.
						If this is you, you have been warned! All players must start on the CBVC
						Advancement team before advancing to CBVC Select. The coaching staff has
						the ability to bring advanced players directly into program. CBVC ran
						tournaments will have experienced referees in their final matches to
						ensure the match is correctly and fairly played. We will encourage hand
						setting and want players that feel comfortable with the skill to use it
						without the worry of the ref calling incorrect lifts and double contacts.
						CBVC Select teams will also be encouraged to compete in the open level
						tournaments. These are the same tourneys that the coaches play. This
						will be the highest level of coaching in Texas and we are excited about
						all the new future professionals to come!

						We determine your skill level and playing experience.
						Based on this, we establish the style of learning that
						is most responsive to you and what you will benefit 
						the most from. We make our assessment, adjust our 
						method to suit your style, then we focus on what
						skills need the most attention. Having played and
						experienced almost every facet of Beach Volleyball,
						we have nearly a dozen ways of explaining each and
						every skill performed in great detail and in ways
						each individual will grasp and get full benefit from.
						It's just a matter of finding the right way for each
						person to respond accordingly.

						We create and customize your training to fit your
						individual skills, needs, and wants. We always
						start with fundamentals and break them down first,
						as fundamentals are the basis for every action that
						we do.  We try to make the game simple and easy
						to understand, allowing you to be as effective
						and efficient as possible. We like to video
						tape the training session (if package is purchased)
						so that the student can see themselves perform
						skills and situations.  This has been a great
						training aid in gaining rapid progress.

						We motivate through goal accomplishment and positive

						ball control, efficient movement, and high

						We train your muscle memory through "perfect practice"
						one step at a time until that fundamental, body movement,
						or skill becomes fluid and thoughtless. During this
						process, we'll keep you aware of the game situation
						that you are practicing in order to keep everything
						relative and concentrated, which also allows you to
						perform the skill or movement without putting any
						thought to it.  Our goal is to ensure that each
						movement is a "reaction" and with controlled thought.
						Frequently we video tape the workout to allow you
						to view your improvements and technique frame by
						frame. We offer a full DVD training package for
						you to take your lessons home with you to study
						and learn from.
